# Outline
  * A customizable, automatic Windows-OS based time tracker that determines the primary application being used, i.e the window in focus and logs the usage time for user-determined applications and websites. It mails a daily report to an email chosen by the user,  and runs automatically the next day. It also logs the records to a txt file allowing for analysis at a later date. Detailed description below.

# Purpose
  * This project came about as I wanted to find a way to determine how much quality time, i.e focus time, I was spending on programming as I am currently a self taught programmer and I found that most available applications were not as customizable as I hoped and therefore I built my own. Through this undertaking, I could better understand the finer nuances of Python and fully appreciate libraries such as datetime, smtp, schedule and re.
